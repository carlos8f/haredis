haredis
-------

High-availability redis in Node.js

Idea
====

**haredis** is a code wrapper around [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis)
which adds fault-taulerance to your application.

Features:

- Drop-in replacement for [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis)
- Easily build a cluster out of 3 or more (default-configured) redis servers
- Auto-failover due to connection drops
- Master conflict resolution (default your servers to master, and **haredis**
  will elect the freshest and issue the `SLAVEOF` commands)
- Freshness judged by an opcounter (incremented on write)
- Locking mechanism to prevent failover contention
- Load-balancing for reads and pub/sub
- One-client pub/sub
- Gossip channel for quick failover

Usage
=====

Start up multiple redis daemons, with no special configuration necessary, and
list them like so:

```javascript
var redis = require('haredis')
  , nodes = ['1.2.3.1:6379', '1.2.3.2:6379', '1.2.3.3:6379']
  , client = redis.createClient(nodes)
  ;
```

...then use `client` as you would use [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis).
If the master node goes down, **haredis** will automatically determine which node
to promote to master, and keep standby connections to the others.

If multiple **haredis** clients are connected, a locking mechanism is implemented
to prevent contention between failover attempts.

To see this in action,

- Set up 3 local redis daemons on ports 6380-82
- 6380 should be `SLAVEOF NO ONE`. 6381 and 82 should be slaves to 6380.
- Run `test/basic.js` or `test/pubsub.js` (try multiple to test contention)
- Kill the process listening on 6380 (master). **haredis** will auto-failover to
  the node it detects is freshest, set that to master, and the others to slaves!
- Bring up 6380, and it will be added as standby for failover.

API differences
===============

`createClient`
--------------

In **haredis**, `createClient` works like this:

```javascript
function createClient([host/port array], options)
```

The first argument can be an array of hosts (using default port), ports (using
localhost), or colon-separated strings (i.e., `1.2.3.4:6379`). **haredis** will
attempt to connect to all of these servers.

`options` corresponds to the same options you would pass
[node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis). **haredis**
additionally supports:

- `haredis_db_num` {Number} database number that **haredis** should store metadata
  in (such as an opcounter). Defaults to `15`.

`auth`
------

`auth` works like this:

```javascript
function auth({host/port to password object}, callback)
```

The first argument can be an object of hosts, ports mapped to passwords
(i.e., `{'1.2.3.1:6379': 'pass1', '1.2.3.3:6379': 'pass2'}`), or just the password
string.

Load-balancing
==============

**haredis** can also load-balance read operations to random slaves. Pub/sub
subscriptions will automatically try to use a slave. For normal read-only
commands, you can choose to query a random slave by using the `slaveOk()` method:

```javascript
client.slaveOk().GET('foo', function(err, reply) { ...
```

`slaveOk()` will only affect the current command.

To load-balance all reads, you can set `options.auto_slaveok = true` in
`createClient()`. Be advised that this can case problems due to replication delay!

One-client pub/sub
==================

In redis, pub/sub is a "mode" which excludes the use of regular commands while
subscriptions are active. Normally you need to make separate client objects to
use `publish` on one and `subscribe` on the other.

**haredis** adds the nice ability to use pub/sub simultaneously with regular
commands. This is because it keeps internal redis clients in pub/sub mode for
internal "gossip", but also makes it available for users. Of course this is
optional, and you can always maintain a separate `haredis` client for subscribes
if you wish.

Advice
======

For proper failover, a majority of the nodes need to be still online. This means
that the minimum number of nodes should be 3. Under the minimum setup, you can
lose up to 1 node. If only 1/3 are up, commands will be queued indefinitely until
another node comes up.

Debugging/verbose logging
=========================

To see what's under the hood, try setting `redis.debug_mode = true`, and you can
see the failover process in detail:

```
[19:27:58](#1) warning: MASTER is down! (127.0.0.1:6380)
[19:27:58](#1) info: reorientating (node down) in 2000ms
Redis connection gone from end event.
[19:28:00](#1) info: orientating (node down, 2/3 nodes up) ...
[19:28:00](#1) warning: invalid master count: 0

[19:28:00](#1) info: lock was a success!
[19:28:00](#1) info: 127.0.0.1:6381 had highest opcounter (1441) of 2 nodes. congrats!
[19:28:00](#1) info: making 127.0.0.1:6382 into a slave...
[19:28:00](#1) info: 127.0.0.1:6382 is slave

[19:28:00](#1) info: renegotating subSlave away from master
[19:28:00](#1) info: subSlave is now 127.0.0.1:6382
[19:28:00](#1) info: ready, using 127.0.0.1:6381 as master
```

To get info on which commands are executed on which servers, try setting
`redis.command_logging = true`.

Running tests
=============

**haredis** includes the test suite from [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis)
which can be run in single or clustered mode.

If you have redis daemons running locally on ports 6380, 6381 and 8382, you can
run the clustered test with:

```bash
$ make test-cluster
```

Or in single-mode with a redis server on port 6379:

```bash
$ make test
```
